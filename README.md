# Welcome to my portfolio site. 

<p>My name is Becca and I've been a technical writer for 7+ years. I make complicated information easy to understand by writing clear and concise customer-facing documentation. I create help guides, release notes, video tutorials, and more.</p>

<p>On my site, you'll find the links to three writing samples. Click on the link to go to the writing sample.
