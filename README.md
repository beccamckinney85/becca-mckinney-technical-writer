# Welcome to my portfolio site. 

<p>My name is Becca and I've been a technical writer for 7+ years. I make complicated information easy to understand by writing clear and concise customer-facing documentation. As a technical writer, I create help guides, configuration documents, release notes, video tutorials, and more.</p>
