# Welcome to my portfolio site. 

<p>My name is Becca and I've been a technical writer for 7+ years. I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Technical Communication from Kennesaw State University.  
  
As a technical writer, I make complicated information easy to understand. I create help guides, configuration documents, release notes, video tutorials, and more, making sure all of my work is clear and concise.</p>
