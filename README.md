# Welcome to my technical writing portfolio. 

<p>My name is Becca and I've been a technical writer for 7+ years. I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Technical Communication with a concentration in Data Analysis and Presentation.  
  
I create user-focused documentation—like help guides, configuration docs, release notes, and video tutorials—to make complex tasks easier and improve the overall user experience. I work daily with tools like MadCap Flare, Jira, Confluence, and GitHub to plan, write, and manage content efficiently.</p>
